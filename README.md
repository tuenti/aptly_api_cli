# aptly_api_cli

### Why do we need another aptly cli interface?
- Because aptly-api-cli has a lot of more features build in.
- aptly-api-cli is made accessible to the python community
- aptly-api-cli utils are already integrated into a CI Workflow
- Additional scripts are offered (see ci-scripts folder), which can be used along your CI jobs (e.g. jenkins)


# Description
This python command line interface, executes calls to the Aptly server remotely, without blocking the Aptly database.
All functionality from here http://www.aptly.info/doc/api/ is extended by even more useful features, like showing or cleaning out snapshots, packages for couple of repos or mirrors.

You can make either use of the aptly_api_request.py as a starting point for your own application or just use the cli (aptly_api_cli.py)
bundled with this repository to execute your requests via command line or run scripts, calling the cli, integrated into a CI Workflow.

This project is in use on production for www.lambdanow.com running on a JENKINS server.

# Build

```
  mkvirtualenv aptly-cli
  pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
  ./aptly-api-cli --help
```

# Installation

```
  python setup.py install
  aptly-cli --help
```

or create a debian package (see debian folder) and install it, locally.


# Get started
Quickstart: Look into the ci-scripts folder to explore aptly-cli in action.

## How to configure aptly server on a CI with JENKINS?

We use upstart: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/ to ensure, aptly server is running (here on Ubuntu 12.04).

Therefore, please create a file: /etc/init/aptly.conf

with content:

```

description "starting aptly"
author "maxMuster@muster.de"

start on runlevel [2345]

stop on runlevel [!2345]

setuid jenkins

script
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="PUT_YOUR_AWS_CREDENTIAL_HERE"
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="PUT_YOUR_AWS_CREDENTIAL_HERE"

    /usr/bin/aptly api serve -config=/var/lib/jenkins/.aptly.conf -listen=":80"
end script

```

## Extensions
Further functionalities improving your aptly CI workflow.


#### Create configuration file
Creates standard config file (aptly-cli.conf) at $HOME directory.

```
aptly_api_cli --create_config
```
Please Note: You can configure the following keys:

- basic_url: the basic url
- port: the port
- prefixes_mirrors: prefixes for all mirrors that you have created
- repos_to_clean: reponames, which should be searched for to be cleaned out
- package_prefixes: package-prefixes, which should be searched for to be cleaned out
- save_last_pkg: Number of package-versions for each prefix, that should be kept
- save_last_snap: Number of snapshot-versions for each prefix, that should be kept
- repos: 3rd party s3 buckets to publish switch to
- staging_snap_pre_post: Pre and postfix of the staging snapshots
- auth: user to authenticate using basic auth
- password: password to authenticate using basic auth

See an working example (aptly-cli.conf):

```
# aptly-cli config file
[general]
basic_url=http://localhost
port=:80
prefixes_mirrors=tuenti
repos_to_clean=unstable_repo
package_prefixes=nginx
save_last_pkg=10
save_last_snap=3

[3rd_party]
# 3rd party s3 buckets to publish switch to
repos=3rdparty-eu-west-1, 3rdparty-us-east-1
# Pre and postfix of the staging snapshots
staging_snap_pre_post=3rdparty-s3-repo, 3rdparty-staging_snapshot

[auth]
user=jenkins
password=
```



#### Get last n snapshots sorted by prefix
Returns the last n snapshots by prefix or optional postfix.
```
aptly_api_cli --get_last_snapshots=PREFIX NR_OF_VERS [POSTFIX]
```

#### Clean out last n snapshots by prefix
Cleans the last n snapshots by prefix or optional postfix.
 ```
 aptly_api_cli --clean_last_snapshots=PREFIX NR_OF_VERS [POSTFIX]
 ```


#### List all repos and packages
List all repos with their containing packages.
```
 aptly_api_cli --list_repos_and_packages
 ```

#### Get last n packages by reponame and sorted by prefix
Returns the last n packages by reponame, prefix or optional postfix.
```
 aptly_api_cli --get_last_packages=REPO_NAME PREFIX NR_OF_VERS [POSTFIX]
 ```

#### Clean last n packages by reponame and sorted by prefix
Delete the last n packages by reponame, prefix or optional postfix.
```
  --clean_last_packages=REPO_NAME PREFIX NR_OF_VERS [POSTFIX]
```

#### Diff all mirror snapshots
Sorts list of snapshots and makes a diff between the last two.
```
 aptly_api_cli --diff_both_last_snapshots_mirrors

```

#### Clean all mirror snapshots
Cleans out snapshots, which were taken from mirrors (from config)
```
 aptly_api_cli --clean_mirrored_snapshots

```

#### Clean all packages from repos
Cleans out packages globally, which were taken from repo names (from config)
```
 aptly_api_cli --clean_repo_packages

```

#### Publish 3rd party staging snapshot to production
Publish the last 3rd party staging snapshot to production (e.g. s3 bucket), only if new content is available. The taken snapshot
stems from the script 'update-3rdparty-staging.sh'.

```
 aptly_api_cli --publish_switch_3rdparty_production

```


## CI - Scripts

This script is called by other scripts, just to check if aptly server is alive.
```
aptly-check-port-running.sh
```

This script is called, whenever we release new software as debian package to staging or production repositories (No 3rd Party).
```
publish.sh 'cluster-manager' 'unstable'
```

This script starts the 3rdPartyMirror update chain beginning from staging:
```
update-3rdparty-staging.sh
```
